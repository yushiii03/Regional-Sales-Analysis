# Regional-Sales-Analysis
## Project Background
Company X, established in 2017, is a manufacture company that sells and ship furnitures to enterprises and individual business.

The company has significantly amount of data on its sales,product offerings, patching regions, and customer information. This project thoroughly analyzes and synthesizes the company's data to provide critical insights and strategic planning over its commercial performances.

Insights and recommendations are provided on the following key areas:

- **Sales Trend Analysis:** Evaluate historical sales patterns across regions over years, focusing on Aggregated Monthly Sales, Average Order Value(AOV), and Profit Margin. 
- **Product Level Performance:** An anlysis on Company X's various product lines, understanding their impact on profits and budgets.
- **Risk Assessment:** An assessment over fluctuation in annual revenues to mitigate risks in future planning.
- **Regional Comparison:** An evaluation of revenue and order counts by regions.

The python notebook used to inspect and perform exploratory data analysis can be found [here](https://github.com/yushiii03/Regional-Sales-Analysis/blob/736142c758c04de091af8fe58b520c201b113a91/Regional_Sales_Analysis.ipynb).

An interactive Tableau dashboard used to report and explore sales trends can be found [here](https://public.tableau.com/shared/69K9WWHFN?:display_count=n&:origin=viz_share_link).



## Data Structure & Initial Checks

The company's main database structure as seen below consists of six tables: Sales Order, Customers, Products, Regions, 2024 Budgets, State Regions, with a total row count of 65,382 records. A description of each table is as follows:
- **Sales Order:** Order records from 2021 to 2025, 64,105 orders in total. Each order contains a unique order number, follow by date the order is placed, customer information, delivery index, and order price. This table contains several primary keys from customers, products, and regions tables, so it serves as primary source when merging tables. Several columns such as warehouse code, currency code, and delivery region index have been removed since they contribute trivially to the analysis.
- **Customers:** A list of 175 customers who ordered in the past four years.
- **Regions:** A reference of all the cities available for delivery, with detailed information regarding geographical location and population census. Irrelevant columns from this table has been removed during data cleaning.
- **State Regions:** Categories all the states into four regions: south, west, northeast, midwest.
- **Products:** Displays 30 products for sale.

# Executive Summary

### Overview of Findings
Sales are growing, but profitability needs scrutiny: While the company shows a general upward trend in sales with end-of-year peaks, a deeper analysis reveals that not all top-selling products are also the most profitable, and most revenue are generated by distributors. Moreover, customer concentration is a risk: The analysis identifies a small number of customers contributing to a large portion of the sales.

# Assumptions and Caveats:

Throughout the analysis, multiple assumptions were made to manage challenges with the data. These assumptions and caveats are noted below:

* Assumption 1 (ex: missing country records were for customers based in the US, and were re-coded to be US citizens)
  
* Assumption 1 (ex: data for December 2021 was missing - this was imputed using a combination of historical trends and December 2020 data)
  
* Assumption 1 (ex: because 3% of the refund date column contained non-sensical dates, these were excluded from the analysis)
