# Regional-Sales-Analysis
## Project Background
Company X, established in 2017, is a manufacture company that sells and ship furnitures to enterprises and individual business.

The company has significantly amount of data on its sales,product offerings, patching regions, and customer information. This project thoroughly analyzes and synthesizes the company's data to provide critical insights and strategic planning over its commercial performances.

Insights and recommendations are provided on the following key areas:

- **Sales Trend Analysis:** Evaluate historical sales patterns across regions over years, focusing on Aggregated Monthly Sales, Average Order Value(AOV), and Profit Margin. 
- **Product Level Performance:** An anlysis on Company X's various product lines, understanding their impact on profits and budgets.
- **Risk Assessment:** An assessment over fluctuation in annual revenues to mitigate risks in future planning.
- **Regional Comparison:** An evaluation of revenue and order counts by regions.

The python notebook used to inspect and perform exploratory data analysis can be found [here](https://github.com/yushiii03/Regional-Sales-Analysis/blob/736142c758c04de091af8fe58b520c201b113a91/Regional_Sales_Analysis.ipynb).

An interactive Tableau dashboard used to report and explore sales trends can be found [here](https://public.tableau.com/shared/69K9WWHFN?:display_count=n&:origin=viz_share_link).



## Data Structure & Initial Checks

The company's main database structure as seen below consists of six tables: Sales Order, Customers, Products, Regions, 2024 Budgets, State Regions, with a total row count of 65,382 records. A description of each table is as follows:
- **Sales Order:** Order records from 2021 to 2025, 64,105 orders in total. Each order contains a unique order number, follow by date the order is placed, customer information, delivery index, and order price. This table contains several primary keys from customers, products, and regions tables, so it serves as primary source when merging tables. Several columns such as warehouse code, currency code, and delivery region index have been removed since they contribute trivially to the analysis.
- **Customers:** A list of 175 customers who ordered in the past four years.
- **Regions:** A reference of all the cities available for delivery, with detailed information regarding geographical location and population census. Irrelevant columns from this table has been removed during data cleaning.
- **State Regions:** Categories all the states into four regions: south, west, northeast, midwest.
- **Products:** Displays 30 products for sale.

# Executive Summary

### Overview of Findings
Sales are growing, but profitability needs scrutiny: While the company shows a general upward trend in sales with end-of-year peaks, a deeper analysis reveals that not all top-selling products are also the most profitable, and most revenue are generated by distributors. Moreover, customer concentration is a risk: The analysis identifies a small number of customers contributing to a large portion of the sales.

# Insights Deep Dive
### Overall Sales Performance & Trends:

* **The company's sales demonstrated a consistent and healthy upward trend from 2021 to 2025.** The analysis of the df_sales dataset across the four-year period shows a general increase in both sales volume and total revenue. While specific quantitative values for year-over-year growth were not included, the trend indicates a robust and expanding business. The data appears to be complete for the period, providing a solid foundation for this observation.
  
* **Sales exhibit strong seasonality, with significant peaks occurring in the last quarter of each year.** A time-series analysis of sales data reveals a notable recurring spike in revenue towards the end of each year. This trend suggests that holiday demand, year-end promotions, or specific product launches may be driving these increases. This is a critical observation for planning marketing and inventory management.

* **The company maintained a low order return rate throughout the period.** The analysis of the df_sales data, particularly by examining the refund dates, shows a low volume of returns. This suggests high customer satisfaction with the products and an efficient order fulfillment process, which is a positive indicator for operational health.
  
* **The core sales data, including Line Total and Order Quantity, was clean and reliable for analysis.** The report noted that the primary sales transaction data had no missing values in key columns. This consistency is crucial as it ensures that all calculations for revenue, profit, and trends are based on a complete and accurate dataset.

### Customer and Channel Performance:

* **There is a key distinction between top-selling products and the most profitable products.** The analysis of top 5 products by Line Total (revenue) did not perfectly align with the top 5 products ranked by the newly created Profit column. This indicates that some products with high sales volume may have lower profit margins due to higher unit costs, while other products with lower sales volumes may be more profitable.
  
* **The company has a high degree of customer concentration, with a small number of accounts driving a large portion of sales.** The report identified the top 10 customers based on their sales contributions. This finding suggests that a significant portion of the company's revenue is dependent on a select group of high-value accounts. While positive, this also represents a risk if any of these key customer relationships were to be lost.
  
* **The "Distributor" sales channel is the primary driver of revenue.** The channel analysis showed that "Distributor" was the top-performing sales channel, contributing the most to overall revenue. This highlights the success of the company's relationships with its distributors and suggests a need to maintain and strengthen these partnerships. While the "Distributor" channel is performing well, the company may want to investigate how to grow other channels to reduce reliance on a single source of revenue and increase overall market reach.

### Regional Performance and Budget Adherence:

* **Regions share revenue evenly while sales heavily relied on California** The regional analysis pinpoints the top 10 regions by total revenue. This information is critical for geographical resource allocation, helping to prioritize marketing efforts and sales team support in areas where the company has a strong market presence.
  
* **The analysis can be used to compare sales performance against regional budgets.** The report mentions the use of a df_budgets dataframe. This suggests that actual sales performance can be compared to pre-defined goals, allowing management to evaluate the effectiveness of regional teams and identify areas that are underperforming.

# Recommendations:

Based on the insights and findings above, we would recommend the Sales and Marketing teams to consider the following: 

* The company's sales show a healthy upward trend, with noticeable seasonal peaks at the end of each year. **Develop and launch targeted promotional campaigns and product bundles specifically for the fourth quarter to maximize revenue during these peak seasons.**
  
* The top-selling products are not always the most profitable. **A more in-depth profitability analysis of the top-selling products should be conducted to evaluate their cost structure and pricing strategy, with the goal of increasing profit margins.**
  
* The "Distributor" channel is the single largest contributor to sales. **Invest in strengthening partnerships within the "Distributor" channel through dedicated support, co-marketing opportunities, and incentive programs to further capitalize on its success.**
  
* A significant portion of sales comes from a few key customers. **Develop a strategic account management program for the top 10 customers to ensure their satisfaction and retention, while simultaneously exploring strategies to diversify the customer base and reduce concentration risk.**
  
* The top 10 regions are the key drivers of sales. **Allocate marketing and sales resources to these top-performing regions to sustain growth and identify opportunities for expansion in other markets.**
  


# Assumptions and Caveats:

Throughout the analysis, multiple assumptions were made to manage challenges with the data. These assumptions and caveats are noted below:

* Assumption 1: The Regional Sales Dataset.xlsx file is a complete, accurate, and true representation of the company's entire sales history from 2021 to 2025.

* Assumption 2: The Total Unit Cost data is a true representation of the cost of goods sold, and does not include other operational expenses. The calculated Profit column therefore represents a gross profit, and not a net profit.

* Assumption 3: Because the report did not contain a time-based analysis of Total Unit Cost, it was assumed that product costs were constant over the period. Any fluctuations in cost were not considered.

* Caveat 1: The provided report summary did not include specific quantitative values (e.g., total sales, specific profit figures). The insights provided are based on the qualitative descriptions of trends and rankings.
